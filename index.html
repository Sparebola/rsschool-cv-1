          In the past, I was a professional eSports player for about 6 years. This industry is very shaky for many reasons, so I redirected 
          all my enthusiasm and attention towards front-end development, which captivated me headlong. For some reason, I always thought that 
          programmers are some kind of super-humans, but when my good friends opened my eyes to the fact that everything is not so scary here 
          and you can constantly improve yourself as in the same video games - I just fired up with happiness. My goal is to become a good 
          specialist in this field, and I know for sure that I will definitely have enough purposefulness for this.
