### About Me
In the past, I was a professional eSports player for about 6 years. This industry is very shaky for many reasons, so I redirected all my enthusiasm and attention towards front-end development, which captivated me headlong. For some reason, I always thought that programmers are some kind of super-humans, but when my good friends opened my eyes to the fact that everything is not so scary here and you can constantly improve yourself as in the same video games - I just fired up with happiness. My goal is to become a good specialist in this field, and I know for sure that I will definitely have enough purposefulness for this. 

### My skills:
* Advenced JS  
* HTML, CSS(SASS, Bootstrap)  
* BEM  
* git, npm  
* Figma, Adobe Photoshop  
* VSCode
